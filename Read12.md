# EJS PARTIALS

> Think of partials as functions, they make large websites easier to maintain as you donâ€™t have to go and change a piece of text in every page it appears in.

It is just deviding the page to parts in order to edit and handle really easier and i t will look polit and fancy

you dont have to apply the settings once more or have to fix the errors and conflicts from using the same CSS file on so many pages.

and here it come the EJS PARTIALS benefit

create the navbar.ejs and let it contain it

do the same for the footer and all the reusable parts of your page

You use `<%- include( PARTIAL_FILE ) %>` where the partial file is relative to the template you use it in.

And that's it
